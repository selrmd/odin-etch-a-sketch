This is my solution to Odin's Etch-A-Sketch<br>
It was a fun project to make!<br>

# How it works:
* Choose a grid density (pixel size) between 10 & 100.<br>
* Default color is black, if you want random color for each pixel, click "Random Color!".<br>
* To erase the canvas but keep the current grid density, click "Erase".<br>
* If you want a new grid, enter your new value, press "Enter" or click "OK".<br>
